            Although the term esport began to be used only after the year 2000, some
            We can map the beginning of the sport from the very beginning of the video games themselves. First
            an event that could be considered an sports tournament between each other in
            October 1972 organized students at Stamford University in the game Spacewar.
            The prize for first place was an annual subscription to Rolling Stones magazine. But
            The first truly official competition took place in 1980, and about in the game Space
            Invaders. The Space Invaders championship took part around
            10,000 players and the tournament received a lot of media attention.

            In the eighties, so-called highscore began to appear in many games.
            The creators of the games decided to record the best results achieved, even
            were recorded in the Guinness Book of Records. This motivated many players to
            training and overcoming these results. In the 1990s p
            With the rise of the Internet, the game scene also changed. Players could connect
            over the Internet and could create multiplayer games as we know them today. IN
            in 1997, the Red Annihilation tournament took place in the game Quake. Tournaments are
            participated by around 2000 competitors and is considered the first Esport event.
            As the main prize of this tournament, one of the creators of Quake donated his Ferrari
            328 GTS.

            In 1998, a new title was released, which took place in this new sports scene
            very successful. Starcraft quickly became very popular. Make up
            became so successful that its successor Starcarft 2 is still among
            the most famous titles on the progaming scene. In 2002, a game was released
            title that will give rise to a new genre of games that will become one of
            most successful in the industry. This is a strategy game Warcraft 3
            and the mode he gets later. Defense of the Ancients, or for short
            DotA lays the foundation for new MOBA games. Nowadays, they are already sports
            tournaments on a daily basis.
